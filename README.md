## Project Description

### - Zshoes' objective is to consistently provide the highest value product defined by unique shoe designs and novel style mixes intended to excite people. We try to improve the quality of life for our customers by staying ahead of fashion trends, especially in designs that define luxury and comfort. This company's primary target audience will be teenagers, as they are the ones that often buy/trade expensive rare shoes. Customers will be pleased since the firm will always have shoes in stock. As a hypbeast, I feel that this company will solve the problem of people being cheated all around the world for counterfeit shoes that should have been real to begin with.
